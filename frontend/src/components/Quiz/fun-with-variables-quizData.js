    explanation: `In Python, we use **variables** to store things like numbers and words. For example:\n\n\`\`\`python\nage = 10\nname = "Alice"\n\`\`\`\nHere, we store the number 10 in a box called 'age' and the name "Alice" in a box called 'name'.`,
    question: "What is stored in the box called 'age'?",
    options: ["10", "Alice", "Python", "Hello"],
